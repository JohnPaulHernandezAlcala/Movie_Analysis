# Film Industry Analysis & Insights

## Description 
This project gives a better understanding of the movie industry. A presentation that summarizes what type of films do the best at the box office is also included here. Findings from both the project and presentation are translated into actionable insights anyone can use when deciding what type of films to create.


## Where to Start First:

### 1. Access the [Table of Content](https://github.com/JohnPaulHernandezAlcala/Movie_Analysis/blob/master/Table%20of%20Content.ipynb) for navigation and a breakdown of the analysis process.
NOTE: For full navigation abilities, open up Table of Content in Jupyter Notebook.
### 2. Follow along with the coding narrative and comments.
### 3. Preview the uploaded presentation, [Film Industry Analysis & Insights](https://github.com/JohnPaulHernandezAlcala/Movie_Analysis/blob/master/Presentation-Film%20Industry%20Analysis%20%26%20Insights.pdf).

## Conclusion
### Maturity Rating Finding
From the analysis of maturity ratings,  'PG-13' and 'R' has the most data, and 'G' rated has the highest median R.O.I. value and 75% of its movies have a R.O.I. value above ~75% followed by 'PG', 'PG-13', 'R'-tied-'Not Rated', and 'NC-17'; however, 'R' rated movies are made the most followed by 'PG-13', 'PG', 'Not Rated', 'G', and 'NC-17'

### Genre
Genre for a movie is rarely limited to only one. Therefore, genre variations were analyzed instead. Of the genre variations, common genres that have more than the median R.O.I. movie value of 95.3% are Action/Adventure, Horror, Thriller, Comedy, and Drama.

### Release Season
All seasons release about the same number of movies; thus, R.O.I. distribution could be used for comparison. The season with highest median R.O.I. value is Summer followed by Winter, spring, and Fall. The months release about the same number of movies; therefore, just like seasons, the R.O.I. distribution could be used for comparison. The month with the highest R.O.I. value is Nov, followed by Jul, Jun, Dec, May, Feb, Aug, Mar, Jan, Oct, April, and Sep. Movies are predominantly released on Wed and Fri.

## Recommendations
### Maturity Rating Finding 1: 'PG-13' or 'R' 
 'PG-13' and 'R' movies have more R.O.I.'s values around their respective median value which suggest predictability. Although it would seem logical to select ‘G’ or ‘PG’, the amount of movies released for these two ratings only accounts for ~20% of the data; therefore, it is recommendable to design a movie with 'PG-13' or 'R' rating because of its predictability and amount of movies released with these ratings.

### Genre Finding 2:  Horror or action/Adventure 
Considering the first finding, it is recommendable to design a movie with Action/Adventure, Horror, Thriller, Comedy, and Drama features in it because these genres have more than the median R.O.I. movie value of 95.3% or reach into the top 25%

### Release Date Finding 3: Wed or Fri
Although Summer and Winter have high median values, the frequency of movies that achieved around their respective median value is less certain than with the movies from Spring and Fall; in other words, movies released in Spring and Fall are more likely to have a median R.O.I. that is close to the median R.O.I. value for Spring and Fall.
With this considered, the months were next observed, and it was found that Nov and Dec have the most reliable R.O.I. distributions because they are close to their respective median R.O.I. values. It is recommendable that the best days to release a movie are on Wednesday or Friday because of high R.O.I. median values coupled with reliable R.O.I distributions that accumulate around their respective R.O.I. median values.
