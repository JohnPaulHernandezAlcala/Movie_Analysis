# Film Industry Analysis & Insights

## Description 
This project gives a better understanding of the movie industry. A presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office is also included here. Findings from both the project and presentation are translated into actionable insights anyone can use when deciding what type of films to create.
