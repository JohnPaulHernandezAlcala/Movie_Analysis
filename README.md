# Film Industry Analysis & Insights

## Description 
This project gives a better understanding of the movie industry. A presentation that summarizes what type of films do the best at the box office is also included here. Findings from both the project and presentation are translated into actionable insights anyone can use when deciding what type of films to create.


## Where to Start First:

### 1. Access the [Table of Content](https://github.com/JohnPaulHernandezAlcala/Movie_Analysis/blob/master/Table%20of%20Content.ipynb) for navigation and a breakdown of the analysis process.
### 2. Follow along with the coding narrative and comments.
### 3. Preview the uploaded presentations [Film Industry Analysis & Insights.pdf]

## Conclusion
### Maturity Rating Finding
'G' rated has the highest median R.O.I. value and has 75% of its movies with a R.O.I. value above 100% followed by 'PG',  'PG-13', 'R'-tied-'Not Rated', and 'NC-17'; however, 'R' rated movies are made the most followed by 'PG-13', 'PG', 'Not Rated', 'G', and 'NC-16'

### Genre
Genre for a movie is rarely limited to only one. Therefore, genre variations were analyzed instead. Of the genre variations, common genres that have more than the median R.O.I. movie value of 95.3% are Action/Adventure, Horror, Thriller, Comedy, and Drama.

### Release Season
All seasons release the same number of movies; Thus, R.O.I. distribution could be used for comparison. The season with highest median R.O.I. value is Summer followed by Winter, spring, and Fall. The months release about the same number of movies; therefore, just like seasons, the R.O.I. distribution could be used for comparison. The month with the highest R.O.I. value is Nov, followed by Jul, Jun, Dec, May, Feb, Aug, Mar, Jan, Oct, April, and Sep. Movies are predominantly released on Wed and Fri.

## Recommendations
### Maturity Rating Finding 1: 'PG-13' or 'R' 
Based on the amount of data 'PG-13' and 'R' has and the frequency that rated 'PG-13' and 'R' movies has for R.O.I.'s values around their respective median value suggest predictability; Thus, it is recommendable to design a movie with 'PG-13' or 'R' rating.

### Genre Finding 2:  Horror or action/Adventure 
Considering the first finding, it is recommendable to design a movie with Horror, or Action/Adventure features in it because these genres have more than the median R.O.I. movie value of 95.3%.

### Release Date Finding 3: Wed or Fri
Although Summer and Winter have high median values, the frequency of movies that achieved around their respective median value is less certain than with the movies from Spring and Fall. With this considered, the months were next observed, and it was found that Nov and Dec have the most reliable R.O.I. distributions because they are close to their respective median values. The best days to release a movie are on Wednesday or Friday because of high R.O.I. median values coupled with reliable R.O.I distributions.
