# Film Industry Analysis & Insights

## Description 
This project gives a better understanding of the movie industry. A presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office is also included here. Findings from both the project and presentation are translated into actionable insights anyone can use when deciding what type of films to create.


## Where to Start First:

### 1. Access the [Table of Content](https://github.com/JohnPaulHernandezAlcala/Movie_Analysis/blob/master/Table%20of%20Content.ipynb) for a breakdown of the analysis process and navigation.
### 2. Follow along with the coding narrative and comments.
### 3. Preview the uploaded presentations [Film Industry Analysis & Insights.pdf]

## Conclusion
### Maturity Rating Finding
'G' rated has the highest median R.O.I. value and has 75& of its movies with a R.O.I. value above 100% followed by 'PG',  'PG-13', 'R'-tied-'Not Rated', and 'NC-17'; however, 'R' rated movies are made the most followed by 'PG-13', 'PG', 'Not Rated', 'G', and 'NC-16'

### Genre
Genre for a movie was rarely limited to only one. Therefore, genre variations were analyzed instead. Of the genre variations, common genres that had more than the median R.O.I. movie value of 95.3% were Action/Adventure, Horror, Thriller, Comedy, and Drama.

### Release Season
All seasons released the same number of movies; Thus, R.O.I. distribution could be used for comparison. The season with highest median R.O.I. value was Summer followed by Winter, spring, and Fall. The months released about the same number of movies; therefore, just like seasons, the R.O.I. distribution could be used for comparison. The month with the highest R.O.I. value was Nov, followed by Jul, Jun, Dec, May, Feb, Aug, Mar, Jan, Oct, April, and Sep. Movies were predominantly released on Wed and Fri.

## Recommendations
### Maturity Rating Finding 1: 'PG-13' or 'R' 
Based on the amount of data 'PG-13' and 'R' had and the frequency that 'PG-13' and 'R' movies had R.O.I.'s values around their respective median value suggest predictability; Thus, it is recommendable to design a movie with 'PG-13' or 'R' rating.

### Genre Finding 2:  Horror or action/Adventure 
Considering the first finding, it is recommendable to design a movie with Horror, or action/Adventure features in it because these genres had more than the median R.O.I. movie value of 95.3%.

### Release Date Finding 3: Wed or Fri
Although Summer and Winter had high median values, the frequency of movies that achieved around their respective median value is less certain than with the movies from Spring and Fall. With this considered, the months were next observed, and it was found that Nov and Dec had the most reliable R.O.I. distributions because they were close to their respective median values. The best days to release a movie are on Wednesday or Friday because of high median values coupled with reliable R.O.I distributions.
